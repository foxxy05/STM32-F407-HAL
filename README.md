# STM32-F407-HAL
A collection of STM32 HAL-based examples and mini-projects. This repo stores my practice codes while learning STM32 MCU fundamentals, covering peripherals like GPIO, Timers, PWM, ADC, UART, EXTI interrupts, and more. Each folder contains focused implementations with comments, configuration notes, and reference material for future reuse.
